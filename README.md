# Job-Assistance-System

-->A system designed to assist job applicants in identifying skills based on roles.

-->The proposed system suggests the skills to the job applicant based on his specified roles that the role asks for. It
applies Natural Language Processing and a K-Nearest Neighbors model to match the keywords given by the user with the 
keywords matching the skills. These suggestions are accompanied by links to the learning platforms so that the user 
might achieve some of the desired skills for his target job role.
